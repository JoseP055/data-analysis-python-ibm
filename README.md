## About the Course

- **Course Title:** Data Analysis with Python  
- **Institution:** IBM  
- **Platform:** Coursera  
- **Instructor:** Joseph Santarcangelo, Ph.D., Data Scientist at IBM  
- **Offered by:** IBM Developer Skills Network  

**Course Description:**  
Analyzing data with Python is a key skill for aspiring data scientists and analysts.  
This course takes you from the basics of importing and cleaning data to building and evaluating predictive models. You’ll learn how to collect data from multiple sources, wrangle and format it, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful visualizations.

As you progress, you’ll develop regression models (linear, multiple, and polynomial), construct end-to-end data pipelines, and refine your models for better accuracy.  

Through hands-on labs and projects, you’ll gain experience with key Python libraries such as:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

By completing the course, you will:
- Strengthen your practical data analysis skills.  
- Build confidence working with real-world datasets.  
- Earn an official Coursera Certificate and an IBM Digital Badge recognizing your achievement.
